# Conway's Game of Life

This is a JavaScript interpretation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). There are multiple other solutions on the net, most of which are better optimized for tougher calculations than mine. I wanted to do something different from the standard canvas solutions, so I used simple divs.

To run simply do `npm i` and then `npm start`.
